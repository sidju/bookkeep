accounts:
  # Accounts transferred from the previous bookkeeping, or created to match your
  # inventory/bank-statement/... Should end up being the negative equal of the

  # Incomes and expences are summed to give your total result. In essence, how

groupings:
# This bookkeeping application doesn't allow any increase in money, so to set an
# initial account balance you must subtract it from an "initial_value" account.
# This isn't verified across years, but subtracting from a specific account
# corresponding to an account from previous bookkeeping makes it easy to check
# against the previous year's sums.

  transactions:
  # A transaction should move money between named accounts
  # The moved money should sum to 0, provably not adding any new money.
